# NetCat (nc)
So.... You are on a network, whether its public or private. You just Nmap'd through to see if there was anything interesting and looking for the next step into poking around. Nmap is a great recon tool, but it just isnt scratching that spot that you want. 

"What's that scratch?' You may be asking yourself. Well, it's NetCat. This is made for raw networking utility that lets you manually connect to ports, send data, and see how services respond. This system will let you look for IoT devices and see what they are doing on the network.
